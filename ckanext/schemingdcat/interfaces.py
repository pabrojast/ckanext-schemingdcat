class ISchemingDCATHarvester(Interface):
    """
    This is a common harvesting interface for SchemingDCATHarvester that provides a set of methods to be implemented by a harvester. 
    The methods are designed to be called at different stages of the harvesting process, allowing for 
    customization and extension of the default behavior. 

    The methods include hooks before and after the download of the remote sheet file, before and after the 
    cleaning process, after the parsing of the sheet file, and before and after the creation and update of 
    the dataset. 

    Additionally, there are methods to modify the dataset dict that will be created or updated, and to 
    update the package schema for the creation and update actions.

    Each method is documented with its purpose, parameters, and return values.
